    "### Hypothesis Tests for One Proportion\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic hypothesis test may be the one-sample test for a proportion.  This test is used if we have specified a particular value as the null value for the proportion, and we wish to assess if the data are compatible with the true parameter value being equal to this specified value.  One-sample tests are not used very often in practice, because it is not very common that we have a specific fixed value to use for comparison. For illustration, imagine that the rate of lifetime smoking in another country was known to be 40%, and we wished to assess whether the rate of lifetime smoking in the US were different from 40%.  In the following notebook cell, we carry out the (two-sided) one-sample test that the population proportion of smokers is 0.4, and obtain a p-value of 0.43.  This indicates that the NHANES data are compatible with the proportion of (ever) smokers in the US being 40%. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### One-sample tests for proportions are not used very often in practice for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lack of a specific fixed value: One-sample tests require a specific fixed value to compare the observed proportion against. However, in many real-world scenarios, we often don't have a predetermined value to use as the null hypothesis. Proportions are usually estimated from the data itself, making it challenging to define a specific fixed value for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Context-dependent proportions: Proportions can vary depending on the context, population, or time period under consideration. It is rare to have a universally agreed-upon proportion that can serve as a meaningful null hypothesis for comparison across different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Two-sample tests or regression models: In many cases, researchers are more interested in comparing proportions between two groups (e.g., treatment vs. control) or exploring the relationship between proportions and other variables using regression models. These approaches offer more flexibility and provide additional insights into the data compared to one-sample tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Limitations of hypothesis testing: Hypothesis testing has its limitations and may not always be the most appropriate tool for making statistical inferences. Alternative approaches, such as confidence intervals or effect size estimation, are often favored as they provide more nuanced and informative results.\n",
    "\n",
    "While one-sample tests for proportions have limited applications, they can still be useful in specific scenarios where a specific fixed value is available for comparison. However, it's important to consider the context, limitations, and alternative approaches to draw meaningful conclusions from the data."

The first two lines below carry out tests using the normal approximation to the sampling distribution of the test statistic, and the third line below carries uses the exact binomial sampling distribution.

    "\n",
    "Comparative tests tend to be used much more frequently than tests comparing one population to a fixed value.  A two-sample test of proportions is used to assess whether the proportion of individuals with some trait differs between two sub-populations.  For example, we can compare the smoking rates between females and males. Since smoking rates vary strongly with age, we do this in the subpopulation of people between 20 and 25 years of age.  In the cell below, we carry out this test without using any libraries, implementing all the test procedures covered elsewhere in the course using Python code.  We find that the smoking rate for men is around 10 percentage points greater than the smoking rate for females, and this difference is statistically significant (the p-value is around 0.01)."

Just as with proportions, for comparing means there are one and two-sample tests, z-tests and t-tests, and one-sided and two-sided tests.  As with tests of proportions, one-sample tests of means are not very common, but we illustrate a one sample test in the cell below.  We compare systolic blood pressure to the fixed value 120 (which is the lower threshold for \"pre-hypertension\"), and find that the mean is significantly different from 120 (the point estimate of the mean is 126)."

    "Another important aspect of two-sample mean testing is \"heteroscedasticity\", meaning that the variances within the two groups being compared may be different. While the goal of the test is to compare the means, the variances play an important role in calibrating the statistics (deciding how big the mean difference needs to be to be declared statisitically significant). In the NHANES data, we see that there are moderate differences between the amount of variation in BMI for females and for males, looking within 10-year age bands. In every age band, females having greater variation than males. "

    "The standard error of the mean difference (e.g. mean female blood pressure minus mean mal blood pressure) can be estimated in at least two different ways. In the statsmodels library, these approaches are referred to as the \"pooled\" and the \"unequal\" approach to estimating the variance. If the variances are equal (i.e. there is no heteroscedasticity), then there should be little difference between the two approaches. Even in the presence of moderate heteroscedasticity, as we have here, we can see that the results for the two differences are quite similar. Below we have a loop that considers each 10-year age band and assesses the evidence for a difference in mean BMI for women and for men. The results printed in each row of output are the test-statistic and p-value. "
