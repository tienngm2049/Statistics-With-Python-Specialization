## Course 2 Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python

Welcome to the Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python course! In this course, you will learn essential concepts and techniques for conducting inferences from statistics. By the end of the course, you will have a solid understanding of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for various scenarios, such as one proportion, two proportions, one mean, two dependent means, and two independent means. Additionally, you will gain proficiency in implementing these statistical analyses using Python and popular libraries like Statmodels and Scipy.stats.

Course Highlights:

Confidence Intervals: You will learn how to construct confidence intervals, which provide a range of plausible values for population parameters. We will cover different types of confidence intervals, including those for proportions and means.
Hypothesis Testing: Hypothesis testing is a crucial tool for making decisions based on data. You will delve into hypothesis testing for one proportion, two proportions, one mean, two dependent means, and two independent means. You will gain a solid understanding of the underlying principles and learn how to apply them using Python.
Python Implementation: Throughout the course, you will work extensively with Python to implement the statistical analyses. The Python Statmodels library will be your go-to tool for running various statistical tests, while the Scipy.stats library will further enhance your coding proficiency in statistical analysis.
