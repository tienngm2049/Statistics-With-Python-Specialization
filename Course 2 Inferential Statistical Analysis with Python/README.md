# Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python

I have successfully completed the "Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python" course and would like to share my experience and accomplishments through this GitHub README.

## Course Overview

This course focused on essential concepts and techniques for conducting inferential statistical analysis using Python. By the end of the course, I have gained a solid understanding of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for various scenarios, including one proportion, two proportions, one mean, two dependent means, and two independent means. Moreover, I have developed proficiency in implementing these statistical analyses using popular Python libraries such as Statmodels and Scipy.stats.

## Course Highlights

- **Confidence Intervals**: The course provided comprehensive coverage of constructing confidence intervals, which offer a range of plausible values for population parameters. I have learned different types of confidence intervals, including those for proportions and means, and how to apply them effectively in practical situations.

- **Hypothesis Testing**: Hypothesis testing is a critical tool for making data-driven decisions. The course extensively covered hypothesis testing techniques for one proportion, two proportions, one mean, two dependent means, and two independent means. Through hands-on examples and exercises, I have gained a solid understanding of the underlying principles and acquired the skills to conduct hypothesis tests using Python.

- **Python Implementation**: Throughout the course, I extensively utilized Python to implement various statistical analyses. The Statmodels library proved to be invaluable in running statistical tests, while the Scipy.stats library enhanced my coding proficiency for statistical analysis tasks.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following materials related to the course:

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: I have included Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the code and explanations for different inferential statistical analyses covered in the course. These notebooks serve as valuable resources for understanding the practical implementation of Python in statistical analysis.

- **Datasets**: Sample datasets used in the course are provided, enabling replication of the analyses and experimentation with different scenarios.

## Getting Started

To get started, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can clone this repository and explore the Jupyter notebooks to gain insights into various inferential statistical analysis techniques. Feel free to modify the code and conduct further experiments to deepen your understanding.

## Conclusion

Completing the "Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python" course has equipped me with the necessary skills to perform inferential statistical analysis using Python. I am now confident in my ability to construct confidence intervals, conduct hypothesis tests, and make data-driven decisions. This repository serves as evidence of my proficiency in applying statistical techniques using Python.
