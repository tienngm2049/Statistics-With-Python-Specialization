## Course 2 Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python

Welcome to the Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python course! In this course, I learned essential concepts and techniques for conducting inferences from statistics. By the end of the course, I have gained a solid understanding of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for various scenarios, such as one proportion, two proportions, one mean, two dependent means, and two independent means. Additionally, I have become proficient in implementing these statistical analyses using Python and popular libraries like Statmodels and Scipy.stats.

Course Highlights:

- Confidence Intervals: I have learned how to construct confidence intervals, which provide a range of plausible values for population parameters. The course covered different types of confidence intervals, including those for proportions and means.
- Hypothesis Testing: Hypothesis testing has become a crucial tool for making decisions based on data. I delved into hypothesis testing for one proportion, two proportions, one mean, two dependent means, and two independent means. Through practical examples and exercises, I gained a solid understanding of the underlying principles and learned how to apply them using Python.
- Python Implementation: Throughout the course, I worked extensively with Python to implement the statistical analyses. The Python Statmodels library became my go-to tool for running various statistical tests, and the Scipy.stats library enhanced my coding proficiency in statistical analysis.

I am excited about the knowledge and skills I have acquired in this course. Being able to perform inferential statistical analysis using Python opens doors to a wide range of data analysis and decision-making opportunities. I am confident in my ability to apply these techniques in real-world scenarios and contribute to data-driven insights.
